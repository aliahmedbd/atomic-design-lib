Implement Compose Android Atomic Design to create a unified and consistent design language that speaks across all of your project's applications, ensuring a universal user experience.

# What is Atomic Design?
The core idea behind Atomic Design is breaking down user interfaces into their fundamental parts (atoms like buttons and text fields) and then combining them into larger, reusable components (molecules, organisms, templates, and pages). Applied to Android, this ensures that every element, regardless of which app it appears in, adheres to the same set of design rules.
